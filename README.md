EPISODE 1

## Bilinear Transformation

  In this series, we dive deep into the concept of bilinear transformation in complex variables. Bilinear transformations are used to map one set of complex numbers to another, making them a powerful tool in various applications.

    ## MATLAB Functions Used
    
    Throughout this series, we make use of several MATLAB functions, including:
    
    - `input`: Interactive data input from the user.
    - `simplify`: Simplifying complex expressions.
    - `solve`: Symbolic equation solving.
    - `subs`: Substituting values into symbolic expressions.
